Removes the jQuery Migrate script from the front end of your site.

== Description ==

This plugin removes the jQuery Migrate script (jquery-migrate.js or jquery-migrate.min.js) from the front end of your site.

Most WordPress sites that use up-to-date themes and plugins don't require jQuery Migrate in the front end, and thus the script can be removed. By removing it, the browser will have one less JavaScript file to download and execute. As a result, your site will load faster!
